      "fine-tuning methods as described in Section 3, with some notable differences related to safety concerns.\n",
      "Specifically, we use the following techniques in safety fine-tuning:\n",
      "1. Supervised Safety Fine-Tuning: We initialize by gathering adversarial prompts and safe demonstra-\n",
      "tions that are then included in the general supervised fine-tuning process (Section 3.1). This teaches\n",
      "the model to align with our safety guidelines even before RLHF, and thus lays the foundation for\n",
      "high-quality human preference data annotation.\n",
      "2. Safety RLHF: Subsequently, we integrate safety in the general RLHF pipeline described in Sec-\n",
      "tion 3.2.2. This includes training a safety-specific reward model and gathering more challenging\n",
      "adversarial prompts for rejection sampling style fine-tuning and PPO optimization.\n",
      "3. Safety Context Distillation: Finally, we refine our RLHF pipeline with context distillation (Askell\n",
      "et al., 2021b). This involves generating safer model responses by prefixing a prompt with a safety\n",
      "preprompt, e.g., “You are a safe and responsible assistant,” and then fine-tuning the model on the safer\n",
      "responses without the preprompt, which essentially distills the safety preprompt (context) into the\n",
      "model. We use a targeted approach that allows our safety reward model to choose whether to use\n",
      "context distillation for each sample.\n",
      "4.2.1\n",
      "Safety Categories and Annotation Guidelines\n",
      "Based on limitations of LLMs known from prior work, we design instructions for our annotation team to\n",
      "create adversarial prompts along two dimensions: a risk category, or potential topic about which the LLM\n",
      "could produce unsafe content; and an attack vector, or question style to cover different varieties of prompts\n",
      "that could elicit bad model behaviors.\n",
      "The risk categories considered can be broadly divided into the following three categories: illicit and criminal\n",
      "activities (e.g., terrorism, theft, human trafficking); hateful and harmful activities (e.g., defamation, self-\n",
